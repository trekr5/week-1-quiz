Weekly quiz
===========

It is expected that you will not have time to answer all questions. Try to answer at least one question from each section. (Questions nearer the top of each section are more important to know.)

Ruby basics
-----------

1) Describe the following ruby objects:
for instance [1,2,3] would be "an array containing three elements, the integer 1, the integer 2 and the integer 3"
and "" would be "a blank string"

1a) :crocodile
answer: symbol

1b) "145.73"
answer: string

1c) { :coffee => "cafe" }
answer: an array containing a hash which is a key/value

1d) [ :green, :eggs, :ham ]
answer: an array which contains three elements which are three symbols  

1e) ["tea", {"juice" => "orange"}]
answer: an array which has an element and hash as it's contents]

2) Here is an array:
array = ["Molly", "Greg", "Taz"]
Write a line of ruby that appends the values "Jay" and "Mona" to the array.
answer: array << "Mona" << "Jay"

3) Here is a hash:
hash = { :cow => "Moo", :sheep => "Baah" }
Write a line of ruby that replaces the value of the key :sheep with "Bleat".
answer: hash[:sheep] = "Bleat" 

4) The file number_converter.rb contains a method called convert_number that doesn't do anything.

Replace the #??? comment inside it so that:
  if the argument passed is greater than 5, it returns 3 times the number,
  and if it is less than or equal to 5 it returns the number minus 3.

5) Write a method that takes one argument (an array full of strings) and `puts` each word separately, but in uppercase.

6) What's the difference between an object and an instance?
answer: An object is a representation of the real world i.e. place, person, event and it has both characteristics and actions that it can perform. An instance is almost like a copy of this object and may have different characteristics and actions from the object. For an example an object can be a dog. For an example an object can be a dog  

Testing
-------
7) robot.rb contains a simple class with two methods. robot_spec.rb is the start of a spec file - it runs, but there aren't any tests in it.

a) Write a test that checks greet('Ada') returns the string "HELLO ADA".
b) Write a test that checks calculate(4, 5) returns 9.
c) Write a test that checks calculate(5, 'horse') returns 5.

8) Explain the difference between the rspec methods let and subject.

HTML, CSS and Javascript
------------------------

8) In a sentance, describe:
a) what is HTML?
b) what is CSS?
c) what is Javascript?

9) State if the following lines are HTML, CSS,or Javascript:

a) <p>Lorem Ipsum</p>

b) console.log("Some words");

c) p { background-color: yellow }

d) <table width="50%"></table>

e) <div id="index" class="small left"></div>
